### hey, i'm mihai ✧

gringo vibe coder from brașov, romania.

no dev degree. just me, cursor, and claude figuring things out together.

22 years building online systems. now building tools that protect attention instead of demanding it.

#### current projects

🫀 **[respira pulse](https://respirapulse.dev)** — macos menu bar app for vercel deployments  
🔌 **[respira press](https://respira.press)** — wordpress plugin for ai-assisted editing  
🌿 **[respira](https://respira.cafe)** — operating systems for conscious creators

#### how i build

i think in systems. ai handles the syntax. we meet somewhere in the middle.

75 commits. 31 releases. one weekend. that kind of thing.
